# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to help Louise in funding her play. Using our growing knowledge of excel and many of its functions we built upon our knowledge base and developed a portfolio to best assist Louise and best explain the data in a more perceivable way.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to best assist Louise in deciding when she should start funding her play and the best parameters to have to get the best results in the funding of the play. Using Kickstarter data to best guide our analysis and using several filters and sorting methods we can best gain the required insight to best assist in giving a sound suggestion on when and how to fund her play. Using graphs and bar charts was the best way to display the needed data visually to show correlations in the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Basing our suggestion on the date that other Kickstarter campaigns had started their funding and the resulting percentages of funded versus failed and canceled campaigns.  Using the created [graph](https://github.com/Tpomeroy45/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Theater_Outcomes_VS_Launch.png) from comparing the date funding for similar projects began and the outcomes of these campaigns shows that projects which funding started in May and June had the highest resulting rate of success while campaigns that started funding between September and December had the highest rate of failing or canceling and the lowest chance of the project getting full funding.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges I incurred while working on this project was the fact that I could not get the data set to show properly in the [graph](https://github.com/Tpomeroy45/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png). I had to get assistance and found out along the way that the way that pivot was interpreting my data was in the wrong order and I fix this problem swiftly. The problem still could not be solved, and my results reflect this. My graph looks close to the correct answer, but my chart was still skewed and not correct. With this factor in play I used the data to the best of my abilities and reviewed all of the provided lessens in hopes of finding the section that i messed up in the formulas but I couldnâ€™t figure out the line that I had improperly written. Another difficulty was the vast size of the data, but I rectified this by using the provided filters and sorting.

**- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
One conclusion I can draw from the outcomes based on launch date would be that a good time to start funding would be May or June as those months showed the highest percentage of fully funded campaigns. Another conclusion that can be drawn is that there is a spike in failed campaigns during October and then declining until May when it rises almost to the same level as in October.

**- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
You can conclude multiple things from the data based on outcomes based on goals. One conclusion that can be drawn is the fact that the projects that cost less than $1000 had the highest chance of success at a little over %70. The worst goal you could have is one that was greater than $50000 as this was nearly %60.

**- What are some limitations of this dataset?**
One limit to the data set is that this is only from one site where one can fund projects thus we are only getting one point of reference and this might not be indicative of the population. Another limit is that the demographic of this website we get all the data form might not be all interested in funding plays they might be on the site to promote and fund other types of projects so this might not be the best place to pull data from or at the least I would suggest multiple sources of data to best show results indicative of the population as a whole.

**- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
One graph we could create would be one comparing date funding started versus deadline to better show length of the funding and what would be the best length to provide the best results for a campaign. A table we could create would be one comparing the outcomes to if the project was a staff pick or weas in the spotlight to show if more publicity equates to more funding.
